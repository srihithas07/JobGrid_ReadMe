Job Grid is a comprehensive platform designed to connect job seekers with employers, enabling the posting of job listings and the search for suitable candidates. This project utilizes a modern technology stack, including MongoDB for database management, ReactJS for the front-end interface, NodeJS for server-side operations, and ExpressJS for handling routing and middleware. Through the development of Job Grid, I gained a profound understanding of CRUD operations and user authentication, essential skills in the domain of employment. This project highlights my ability to integrate various technologies to create a functional and user-friendly application, demonstrating my proficiency in full-stack development.
